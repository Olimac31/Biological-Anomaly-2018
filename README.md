# Biological Anomaly (2018) Source Code

This is the source code of that one indie game I worked on when I was 15, which I made for a school project initially but then I kept working on it for a year or so.


It was REALLY fun working on Biological Anomaly, I learnt a lot about coding and it felt like for the first time I was surprisingly not sucking at coding a game (I mean, in comparison to previous projects such as Purki 2014 and the later 2016 prototype).

This project went on hiatus in early 2020 since I started working on HeartDive with some friends. HeartDive is made on Godot 3, and after trying out that engine for about a year, I decided I wanted to completely switch to it rather than going back to GameMaker Studio 1.4


Years passed and I got busy with many other projects, which led to Biological Anomaly's original source code to be locked in the depths of my hard drive for years.
I never stopped thinking about Biological Anomaly, its characters and its music, but I'm currently far too busy to take on a project this large.

I still want to reboot this project at some point, maybe in a couple of years, but that's gonna be done in Godot 3, so... I decided to release the source code of this old prototype made in GMS 1.4!
This project is licensed under Apache 2.0, so feel free to use the code in your stuff :)
Have fun!
